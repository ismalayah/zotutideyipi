The plot — which is adapted from the 2012 novel by the late Richard Wagamese (Ojibwe) — begins with Saul in his early years as a young boy who faced constant oppression due to his Indigenous roots.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>He picks up on the game of <a href=#>hockey</a> as a way to deflect from the harshness that’s seemingly all around him. Even though prejudice is also present on the ice, Saul seems to naturally excel while playing the game, as a means to escape his often difficult life.</p><h2 id=h-the-last-forest data-injectable=false>The Last Forest</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>This 2021 documentary, directed by Luiz Bolognesi, focuses on the Yanomami people. They are one of the most numerous and best-known, forest-dwelling tribes in South America. This tribe of native Brazilians dwell in the Amazon rainforest, a locale on our planet that struggles to be preserved.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>The film has remarkable cohesion between actual documentary footage and scripted scenes, to show audiences a breathtaking part of Earth that these indigenous people so passionately live to protect.

Set in Vancouver, the plot follows one Kwakwaka’wakw woman and another of Blackfoot and Sámi heritage. Their respective yet strikingly different social statuses clash early on but seem to quickly fall by the wayside once they each open their minds to the other’s personal situation.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>The story is based on real-life accounts experienced by Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers, who acted, co-wrote, and co-directed the film. Canadian filmmaker Kathleen Hepburn shared writing and directing duties for the project.

An Oklahoma native with Seminole and Muscogee heritage, Harjo followed indigenous artists as they navigated their unique careers both in the United States and abroad. It’s an in-depth look at several Native artists, many of whom also hail from Oklahoma, while they explore their own identities and the world around them.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Despite its limited release in numerous 2020 film festivals, the piece was also screened in movie theaters and for streaming a year later. In just an hour and a half of runtime though, it’s easy to see how his most popular work so far on Reservation Dogs has been such a success.</p><h2 id=h-rumble-the-indians-who-rocked-the-world data-injectable=false>Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked The World</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>This Canadian documentary from 2017 follows several well-known musicians who are of Native American descent, from both the U.S. and Canada.

It even includes additional input from entertainment legends like Quincy Jones, <a href=#>Martin Scorsese</a>, <a href=#>Steven Tyler</a>, Marky Ramone, Slash, Iggy Pop, and Buddy Guy.</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>This project was actually inspired by an exhibit set up by the film’s executive producers, Salas (Apache) and Tim Johnson (Mohawk), for the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. And as you might expect, this documentary did very well among its audiences. At the 2017 <a href=#>Sundance</a> Film Festival, it won the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award for Masterful Storytelling. It won Best Feature Length Documentary, Best Editing in a Documentary, and Best Cinematography in a Documentary at the Canadian Screen Awards in 2018.</p><h2 id=h-rez-ball data-injectable=false>Rez Ball</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-26-224419.png><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>This film is about the Chuska Warriors, a Native American high school basketball team from New Mexico that sticks together in the face of difficulty. Student-athletes and coaches from the school, who also have Navajo backgrounds tell the inspiring underdog story that was based on real events.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>The aforementioned Sterlin Harjo and director Sydney Freeland adapted this project from Michael Powell’s 2019 nonfiction sports novel titled, Canyon Dreams. Not only that, but because it’s basketball, <a href=#>NBA</a> superstar <a href=#>LeBron James</a> led a team of producers to get this sports drama to streaming status.</p><h2 id=h-lorena-light-footed-woman data-injectable=false>Lorena, Light-footed Woman</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>This inspiring short documentary from 2019 features the real-life story of Lorena Ramirez of the Tarahumara, or self-called Rarámuri. These indigenous people are known for being naturally gifted at long-distance running thanks to living within the mountain ranges of Urique, Chihuahua, in Mexico. Because of the geographical features of that region, basic transportation there is very often achieved on foot.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>The audience is quickly shown how every day involves traversing on foot, making running a marathon like second nature to Lorena. She runs every race dressed in her indigenous cultural attire of skirts and sandals, winning marathons rather easily while gaining popularity with every stride. For presenting such a remarkable tale, the film won Best Short Documentary honors at the 2020 Mexico Ariel Awards.</p><h2 id=h-the-grizzlies data-injectable=false>The Grizzlies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>Produced in 2018 and set in the Canadian hamlet of Kugluktuk, Nunavut, this film, based on a true story, focuses on a very real social epidemic that’s severely affecting the lives of the local youth. With hardly any resources or options, a lacrosse team comprised of the area’s Inuit high school students was formed in an attempt to relieve tensions.</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>The plot manages to flow through several dark days in a striking fashion that the audience just cannot ignore. But for all of its drama and emotions, viewers ultimately do see some signs of hope. It’s definitely a remarkable production, shooting on-location in the actual region in which the film is set and casting young actors who are from that same area. The finished product earned several award nominations and even won director Miranda de Pencier the Directors Guild of Canada award for Best Direction in a Feature Film in 2018.</p><h2 id=h-montford-the-chickasaw-rancher data-injectable=false>Montford: The Chickasaw Rancher</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=758 data-injectable=true>This historical drama was based on the life and times of the real Montford T. Johnson of the Chickasaw Nation – Native Americans who originated mainly in the southeastern portion of the United States. Johnson’s story takes place in what is now Oklahoma, as he went from the all-too-common hardships of life as an indigenous man in the United States to building a widely-respected ranching empire along the historic Chisolm Trail of the late 19th century.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>The movie stars well-known actors Dermot Mulroney and Tommy Flanagan, along with Martin Sensmeier as the titular character. However, apart from the cast, the stunning visuals of the landscape, and the authentic production design, the most interesting facet of this production was that real-life descendants of Johnson appeared as background extras.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoaGllnpbBqsLEZpimnaKesKK6jJ%2BgpaWjYrC2vtGepa2kqWK8r3nNnqufpJmtfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-native-american-films-currently-on-netflix.html&text=10%20Native%20American%20films%20currently%20on%20Netflix&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-native-american-films-currently-on-netflix.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-native-american-films-currently-on-netflix.html&title=10%20Native%20American%20films%20currently%20on%20Netflix" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-native-american-films-currently-on-netflix.html&title=10%20Native%20American%20films%20currently%20on%20Netflix" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-native-american-films-currently-on-netflix.html&title=10%20Native%20American%20films%20currently%20on%20Netflix" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-native-american-films-currently-on-netflix.html&description=10%20Native%20American%20films%20currently%20on%20Netflix" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./desperate-hours-1990.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Desperate Hours movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1990)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./which-star-wars-actors-have-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which Star Wars actors have died?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

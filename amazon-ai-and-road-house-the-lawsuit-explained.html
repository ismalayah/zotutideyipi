One of the most beloved brawling movies of all time in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Road House</a></strong>, one of the best actors around in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> and a company that was eschewing standard moviemaking in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Studios</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, nothing turned out as anyone would have hoped. The director is boycotting the film and the original screenwriter is now suing Amazon Studios for copyright infringement. How did it all go so wrong?</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Let’s start with the start: the original Roadhouse. Released in 1989, Roadhouse tells the story of James Dalton, a cooler hired to turn a raucous honkytonk club into a respectable enterprise. Played by Patrick Swayze with enough swag and sex appeal to fill a swimming pool, it’s an American classic. Oh, and Dalton has a black belt in karate AND a Ph.D. in philosophy.</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>The plot is fairly straightforward. Dalton annoys the wrong person when he fires a bunch of employees and in the process finds himself in the crosshairs of the town’s business tycoon and drug lord, named Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara), who holds the town under his iron grip by using his henchman and intimidation. Dalton tries to improve the Double Deuce while Wesley tries to sabotage the club and kill him. It also stars Kelly Lynch as a love interest and Sam Elliot as a fellow bouncer.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>The remake, which has gone through various actors and writers over the years, is set for release on Prime Video on Mar. 21. It stars Gyllenhaal as a UFC middleweight fighter who ends up working at a “roadhouse” in Florida. The movie supposedly follows some of the same story beats as the original. The original movie was written by R. Lance Hill, who goes by the pen name of David Lee Henry. This brings us to the lawsuit.</p><h2 id=h-the-roadhouse-lawsuit data-injectable=false>The ‘Roadhouse’ Lawsuit</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>This is where things get juicy. Hill filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios along with its parent company, Amazon Studios. He alleges that Amazon deliberately ignored his attempts to get back the rights to the screenplay because it would interfere with the company’s remake. He says Amazon put a deadline on finishing the film (Nov. 10) before the copyright expired and Hill would be able to reclaim his work.</p><p data-characters=672 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>Hill asked the U.S. Copyright Office to return the work to him after the rights expired in November 2023. Hill claims that Amazon didn’t finish the remake in time, due to the writer’s strike, until the end of January this year. The complaint says that the studio “steamrolled ahead with the production of a remake of the 1989 Film derived from Hill’s Screenplay.” To do this, he alleges, the studio used generative artificial intelligence to recreate actors’ voices and finish the film. If this is true, it would mean that Amazon broke the collective bargaining agreements of the strike with SAG-AFTRA and the Director’s Guild of America.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>This lawsuit has huge implications for the future of Hollywood itself, and could very well set a precedent for how studios are allowed to use AI moving forward. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of them by the original authors of works like Friday the 13th and The Terminator. There’s a provision in copyright law that allows authors to reclaim the rights to their work after a period of time, generally around 30 years. This is of course bad news for studios who stand to lose rights to some of the most popular and lucrative franchises in movie history.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>The lawsuit also says that Amazon used AI to finish the film at a “considerable additional cost” instead of honoring his copyright claim. An Amazon spokesperson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released a statement</a> denying the claims.</p><p>“The lawsuit filed by R. Lance Hill regarding&nbsp;Road House&nbsp;today is completely without merit and&nbsp;numerous allegations are&nbsp;categorically false. The film does not use any AI in place of actors’ voices. We look forward to defending ourselves against these claims.”</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Hill wants damages and a court order that validates his November 11, 2023 claim on the work. Amazon Studios, he said, didn’t have “rights to make, produce or distribute the 2024 Remake or any other post-termination derivative work based in whole or in part on the Screenplay and/or the 1989 Film (as derived from the Screenplay).”</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>A lot of things could end up happening here, but most likely they’ll go back and forth for a while and then come to an agreement aka they’ll pay Hill enough money that he won’t care whether or not Amazon used AI or not. If he sticks to his guns and takes it to court, things could get interesting.</p><p data-characters=665 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>This fiasco is the latest controversy in a movie that’s just been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mired in them</a>. Before the lawsuit, the movie’s director got into it with Amazon over its release being streamed and not put in actual movie theaters. Director Doug Liman decided to boycott the film’s premiere because he claims the studio promised him the film would be released in theaters. He released a fiery statement saying that the studio “seems intent on burying” the movie in streaming and not on “the big screen where great movies and movie&nbsp;stars belong.” Studios should put up a sign, he said, that says, “TALENT BEWARE, NOT WELCOME HERE.”</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Interestingly, Gyllenhaal recently was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> by Total Film and pushed back on those claims: “I adore Doug’s tenacity, and I think he is advocating for filmmakers, and film in the cinema, and theatrical releases. But, I mean, Amazon was always clear that it was streaming.”</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=false>Hill’s lawyer, Marc Toberoff, argues that studios keep exploiting talent despite “the asset base of all major entertainment studios” being content. “It is time they respect the fundamental rights and artistry of creators on whose sweat and toil their empires are based.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKaZqqS7bq3IZpinnF2nvKKwjKGmrquVYsGpsYylmLCrpZ7BbrHXqaOaoZ6asXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famazon-ai-and-road-house-the-lawsuit-explained.html&text=Amazon%2c%20AI%2c%20and%20Road%20House%3a%20The%20lawsuit%2c%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famazon-ai-and-road-house-the-lawsuit-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famazon-ai-and-road-house-the-lawsuit-explained.html&title=Amazon%2c%20AI%2c%20and%20Road%20House%3a%20The%20lawsuit%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famazon-ai-and-road-house-the-lawsuit-explained.html&title=Amazon%2c%20AI%2c%20and%20Road%20House%3a%20The%20lawsuit%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famazon-ai-and-road-house-the-lawsuit-explained.html&title=Amazon%2c%20AI%2c%20and%20Road%20House%3a%20The%20lawsuit%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famazon-ai-and-road-house-the-lawsuit-explained.html&description=Amazon%2c%20AI%2c%20and%20Road%20House%3a%20The%20lawsuit%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./colette-simon-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-69464-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Colette Simon Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./amanda-donohoe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amanda Donohoe movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

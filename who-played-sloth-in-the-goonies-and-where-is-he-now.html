An iconic representation of the 1980s and with a cast featuring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, and Martha Plimpton, it’s no wonder this tale of mischievous childhood misadventure remains a fan favorite. Yet although every single member of the Goonies gang holds a special place in our hearts, none possibly more so than the loveable, yet odd, character the crew finds in the basement, Sloth.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Despite the film’s many stars, including “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Chunk” played by Jeff Cohen,</a> Sloth steals the show. Despite his jarring appearance and immense stature, Sloth had a heart of gold that gave him an undeniably endearing quality. His lopsided face, cone-shaped head, and the small tuft of hair that sits atop it are certainly an example of cinematic prosthetic magic. Yet we had to wonder–who was behind the misshapen mask?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-john-matuszak data-injectable=false>Who is John Matuszak?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>Underneath all that makeup (reportedly 5 hours a day’s worth, in fact) is two-time Super Bowl champion John Matuszak, also known as “The Tooz.” Knowing Matuszak was a football player makes so much sense as Sloth is portrayed as a gentle giant, with emphasis on the giant. He is quite an imposing figure, standing at 6’8 and towering over the actors both on and off the set. Although apparently, Sloth and Matuszak’s similarities don’t end there.</p><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Matuszak was known for his wildman antics both on and off the field, so much so that in 2005, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports Illustrated</a> named him one of the top five NFL “bad boys” of all time. He had an interesting and extensive NFL career with The Oakland Raiders before stepping onto the Hollywood scene. You may even notice in one of the scenes of the Goonies Sloth is wearing an Oakland Raiders shirt! Matuszak also had other Hollywood roles in Caveman, The Ice Pirates, Ghost Writer, and Down The Drain though none quite as memorable as his role in The Goonies.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Before playing the loveable monster we all know as Sloth, apparently, Matuszak was a monster on the field too, his giant stature intimidating almost every player he faced. The Wisconsin native was an imposing figure but many reported off the field, that Matuszak was the complete opposite of his usual game-day persona.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>Like the gentle giant he portrayed he was reportedly kind, gentle, and a “joy” to interact with. He was certainly a hit with the ladies, often described as a “hunk” and even posing for Playgirl magazine! Yet not all of his off-field behavior was positive. Despite his successful career in both the NFL and Hollywood, the star had his own demons to face. His excessive partying was well known and, in his autobiography, he admitted that he abused both drugs and alcohol, even during his time as a professional football player.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happened to the actor who played Sloth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>Matuszak’s volatile lifestyle reportedly had roots in his early childhood, as he lost two younger brothers to cystic fibrosis and had a difficult time following their deaths. Other childhood tragedies seemed to follow him into adulthood and many felt his partying lifestyle was an attempt to ease some of the lingering pain. His long-time girlfriend Stephanie Cozart told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times </a>“The man was in a lot of emotional pain. He had a lot of childhood stuff to deal with.”</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>While there was a lot of emotional pain in Matuszak’s life, there was also physical pain, the result of several football injuries that his parents felt introduced him to the world of addictive narcotics due to chronic, ongoing pain.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>In his memoir Cruisin’ with The Tooz, he revealed the depth of his addictions and admitted to hitting rock bottom, but then getting clean after realizing how close he had come to death.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, his recovery was not lifelong, and his relapse into ongoing drinking and drug use led to his accidental overdose and death on June 17, 1989. He was 38 years old. Matuszak had been using the prescription drug Darvocet for pain and took too much.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>It would take 10 lifetimes to write all the crazy stories of the 60's-70's Oakland Raiders. On this day in 1989, John Matuszak died at only 38 y/o. Here he is with Otis Sistrunk & Dave Rowe & transforming into Sloth in the Goonies. <a href=#>#raidernation</a> <a href=#>#Raiders</a> <a href=#>#NFL</a> <a href=#>#tooz</a> RIP <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6HKCcl8xyq</a></p>— James Patrick (@realjamespat) <a href=#>June 17, 2019</a></figure><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>Looper put together a wonderfully in-depth look at the life and death of John Matuszak that can be viewed below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=false>Although Matuszak may no longer be with the Goonies crew in body, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ke Huy Quan (Data) reminds us “Goonies never say die.”</a> Sloth will forever hold a place in the hearts of Goonies fans everywhere. The warmth and compassion he portrayed continue to teach us all a lesson in seeing beneath the exterior, to the person below the surface (or the five hours of makeup). We can all learn something from Sloth and the Goonies family, and we will always have Matuszak to thank for that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXaW5osXEnWSspJ%2BptW61zWaroZ1dnLywusieqmaZnpl6uLTEq5xmoaNitaZ5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-played-sloth-in-the-goonies-and-where-is-he-now.html&text=Who%20played%20Sloth%20in%20The%20Goonies%20and%20where%20is%20he%20now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-played-sloth-in-the-goonies-and-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-played-sloth-in-the-goonies-and-where-is-he-now.html&title=Who%20played%20Sloth%20in%20The%20Goonies%20and%20where%20is%20he%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-played-sloth-in-the-goonies-and-where-is-he-now.html&title=Who%20played%20Sloth%20in%20The%20Goonies%20and%20where%20is%20he%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-played-sloth-in-the-goonies-and-where-is-he-now.html&title=Who%20played%20Sloth%20in%20The%20Goonies%20and%20where%20is%20he%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-played-sloth-in-the-goonies-and-where-is-he-now.html&description=Who%20played%20Sloth%20in%20The%20Goonies%20and%20where%20is%20he%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./robert-card-bio-age-parents-wife-children-net.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Card Bio, Age, Parents, Wife, Children, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./people-compare-dead-island-2-to-dying-light-seemingly-forgetting-which-franchise-came-first-and-who-developed-the-games.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="People compare Dead Island 2 to Dying Light, seemingly forgetting which franchise came f">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

As chronicled in Mallory O’Meara’s book <a href=#>The Lady from the Black Lagoon</a>, her contributions were minimized almost to the point of invisibility by Westmore, who by the common agreement of colleagues lacked the imagination and skills to create such a haunting design.</p><p>The second-best reason to watch the original is the filmmaking, which doesn’t invent anything, but polishes up familiar monster movie story beats and images with conviction, flair, and a voluptuous sense of atmosphere. It was directed by Jack Arnold, who had become one of Universal’s go-to horror filmmakers by the early ‘50s, and written by the team of <a href=#>Harry Essex</a> and Arthur Ross, who specialized in horror, gangster pictures, and other genre movies. Together with the cast and crew, they keep the story chugging along. Even by the accelerated standards of modern features, the second half is enthralling: it’s a cat-and-mouse game pitting the boat crew against the Gill Man. The end result is a compact and intelligent genre piece that fuses elements of the jungle adventure, the horror film, and the environmental cautionary tale, plus trace elements of the original “King Kong,” an earlier classic about a prehistoric jungle creature who kidnaps a human woman from a band of explorers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/63571cdbb8b50d1767f3a40c/content_creature_poster.jpg><p>As explained in&nbsp;<a href=#>a Den of Geek piece</a> by my friend Jim Knipfel, “Creature” was the brainchild of William Alland, a friend of <a href=#>Orson Welles</a> who heard a cinematographer tell the story of “an amphibious humanoid creature who emerged from the Amazon once a year, grabbed a young woman from a local village, and then disappeared again. The other guests got a chuckle out of that, but the cinematographer insisted it was absolutely true, even offering to provide photographic evidence. It’s unclear if anyone ever took him up on that.” When Alland started producing movies for Universal, he wrote a treatment for a script that was essentially “King Kong, but with a human-sized amphibian,” starting the story in the jungle and ending it in the city, where the monster escapes confinement and runs amok. The second half of the story was nixed when the film began production and hired proper screenwriters (it was probably un-doable anyway, given the limited budget), but it ended up being resuscitated and scaled down&nbsp;for the first sequel, “Revenge of the Creature,” in which the Gill Man becomes an “attraction” at a theme park. Shot and released in 3-D format at the height of the craze, “The Creature” was a surprise smash, earning back ten times its $500,000 production budget and becoming the first entry in a trilogy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmprKjZLOzu8xmq6GdXZmypryMqKVmrJiaerTAwLKgp59dpby4sdFmpp9lk6eyosDUq5xmnqKkum7Ax55km6SRmLhuuMCgpqim</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrom-the-deep-on-the-staying-power-of-creature-from-the-black-lagoon.html&text=From%20the%20Deep%3a%20On%20the%20Staying%20Power%20of%20Creature%20from%20the%20Black%20Lagoon%20%7c%20MZS&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrom-the-deep-on-the-staying-power-of-creature-from-the-black-lagoon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrom-the-deep-on-the-staying-power-of-creature-from-the-black-lagoon.html&title=From%20the%20Deep%3a%20On%20the%20Staying%20Power%20of%20Creature%20from%20the%20Black%20Lagoon%20%7c%20MZS" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrom-the-deep-on-the-staying-power-of-creature-from-the-black-lagoon.html&title=From%20the%20Deep%3a%20On%20the%20Staying%20Power%20of%20Creature%20from%20the%20Black%20Lagoon%20%7c%20MZS" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrom-the-deep-on-the-staying-power-of-creature-from-the-black-lagoon.html&title=From%20the%20Deep%3a%20On%20the%20Staying%20Power%20of%20Creature%20from%20the%20Black%20Lagoon%20%7c%20MZS" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrom-the-deep-on-the-staying-power-of-creature-from-the-black-lagoon.html&description=From%20the%20Deep%3a%20On%20the%20Staying%20Power%20of%20Creature%20from%20the%20Black%20Lagoon%20%7c%20MZS" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./allen-garfield.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Allen Garfield movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ella-bleu-travolta.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elle Bleu Travoltz, Bio, Career, Married , Husband, Affair, Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

The couple met back in 2004, and in less than a year the two married, since when the couple has welcomed a son Wyatt, born on the 2nd August 2006, and a daughter Reagan, who was born on the 29th October 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/larry-the-cable-guy-premiere-cars-2-03.jpg><h2><span id=Cara_Whitney_Life_Before_Larry_the_Cable_Guy>Cara Whitney: Life Before Larry the Cable Guy</span></h2><p>Cara hasn’t revealed much about her childhood, and all we know for now is that she spent most of it on a farm in Wisconsin. She was born in the year of 1976, but her exact birth date and place have been kept from the media.</p><p>Before she met Daniel, or Larry the Cable guy, Cara was working as a radio DJ on a local station in Los Angeles, California. Cara has now also authored a book – “Unbridled Faith: 100 Devotions From The Horse Farm” – in 2018, which has increased her wealth, but no further information has been made available about her life and career.</p><h2><span id=Cara_Whitney_Wedding>Cara Whitney Wedding</span></h2><p>The wedding ceremony took place in July 2005, held in an open field in Nebraska, with both of them wearing casual clothes.

He went to The King’s Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, and later matriculated from Berean Christian School in West Palm Beach. He furthered his studies by enrolling at the Baptist University of America in Georgia, and then the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he majored in drama and speech, however, after only one year he dropped out to focus on his career in the entertainment industry.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings_and_Rise_to_Prominence>Career Beginnings and Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p>At the start of his career, he performed under his birth name, but without success, however, once he created the Larry the Cable Guy character, a redneck with a southern accent and a catchphrase, Git-R-Done!, his career started improving. Since then, Larry has become a household name, and he has had success on radio, TV and stage as well. Also, he has released a number of comedy albums, including “Lord, I Apologize”, “A Very Last Christmas”, and “The Right to Bare Arms”, which have achieved gold and platinum status. His most famous television creations were the comedy shows “Blue Collar TV” (2004-06), and “Bounty Hunters” in 2013.</p><h2><span id=Larry_the_Cable_Guy_Net_Worth_and_Charity_Work>Larry the Cable Guy Net Worth and Charity Work</span></h2><p>Over the years, Larry has become a successful stand-up comedian, and his success has only increased his wealth.

He said, ”</p><p>“I’m not sure how that would work, but if someone came up with the proper concept, I’d be open to it.”</p><p>Brendan Fraser played action hero Rick O’Connell in three distinct The Mummy films between 1999 and 2008. The films — The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor — have remained popular throughout the years. Fraser was allegedly one of the most paid actors at the time these films were shot. His net worth was $45 million, and each of his acting roles would cost roughly $10 million. This high, however, did not last long. A slew of challenges, including health concerns, large alimony payments, divorce settlements, legal issues, and a string of disappointing films, reduced the actor’s net worth by almost half by 2023.</p><h2>Despite a rocky career, Brendan Fraser has a net worth of $20 million.</h2><p>Brendan Fraser has almost 70 acting credits, although he is best recognized for his roles in The Mummy films, George of the Jungle, and Encino Man. He is also well-known for his notable guest appearance on the NBC sitcom Scrubs during a three-episode arc.&nbsp;Between 1998 to 2008, Fraser was married to Afton Smith. After selling their Beverly Hills home for $3 million in 2007, the couple announced their divorce in 2008. The couple is the parents of three children.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brendan-Fraser.jpg alt="Brendan Fraser" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Fraser found it difficult to satisfy the financial obligations of the alimony arrangement since it was drafted at the height of his career. He was paying $75,000 a month in alimony and child support, in addition to other costs.&nbsp;In March 2013, he asked that the alimony be reduced in accordance with the divorce settlement since his yearly income had dropped below $3 million. Afton Smith claimed that Fraser lied about his income, and Fraser paid his ex-wife a settlement of roughly $8.7 million.&nbsp;Following the divorce, Fraser spent $4 million on a house in Bedford, New York. Alimony payments are said to have halted in 2019. Fraser will continue to pay child support until his eldest kid reaches the age of 18.</p><h2>The actor’s withdrawal from public view</h2><p>Aside from the alimony, the actor had a slew of health difficulties from his days of conducting his own stunts in movies. Fraser had many procedures, including a laminectomy, knee replacement, vocal chord replacement, and various back surgeries. As a result, he was unable to participate in high-paying action flicks.</p><p>Despite the fact that he continues to make films every year, they have not helped him regain his earlier fame. In an interview with GQ in 2018, the actor revealed that he was attacked by former Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) President Philip Berk. This followed a lawsuit filed by the HFPA, and although the specifics of the case were not disclosed, Fraser acknowledged to feeling blacklisted by the business.</p><p>He also discussed the impact of losing his mother on him and admitted to doubting his identity and what he was doing during his professional downturn.&nbsp;Brendan Fraser has slowly made his way back into the mainstream in recent years, thanks to shows like The Doom Patrol and Professionals. The actor got excellent accolades for his performance in The Whale, including a standing ovation after the film’s showing at the Venice Film Festival.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brendan-Fraser-2.jpg alt="Brendan Fraser" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Brendan Fraser has joined Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese’s next film The Killers of the Flower Moon. With his health in better form, the actor is able to obtain more parts and increase his net worth.&nbsp;With the support of many fans, this might be an ideal moment for another Mummy picture.&nbsp;In the interview, the actor said that the 2017 Tom Cruise film was a failure owing to a lack of “fun,” and he admitted:</p><p>I know how tough it is to pull it off since I tried three times.</p><p>Following this, many fans are now excitedly anticipating the release of a new The Mummy film starring Brendan Fraser, whenever that may be.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmaaopq7pa3NZp2rmaOav266xK1ksKeiqbVuv8ClmKuxXZius7HEq2Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-rich-is-brendan-fraser-net-worth-salary-career.html&text=How%20Rich%20Is%20Brendan%20Fraser%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-rich-is-brendan-fraser-net-worth-salary-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-rich-is-brendan-fraser-net-worth-salary-career.html&title=How%20Rich%20Is%20Brendan%20Fraser%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-rich-is-brendan-fraser-net-worth-salary-career.html&title=How%20Rich%20Is%20Brendan%20Fraser%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-rich-is-brendan-fraser-net-worth-salary-career.html&title=How%20Rich%20Is%20Brendan%20Fraser%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-rich-is-brendan-fraser-net-worth-salary-career.html&description=How%20Rich%20Is%20Brendan%20Fraser%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./indian-oaks-antique-mall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Indian Oaks Antique Mall | Enjoy Illinois">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ryan-paid-me-errol-spence-opines-on-ryan-garcia-honoring-the-bet-on-rolly-romero-vs-tank-davis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan paid me Errol Spence opines on Ryan Garcia honoring the bet on Rolly Romero vs Tank Davis">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
